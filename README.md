# perinatal-health-risk-prediction
Perinatal health risk prediction involves analyzing maternal and fetal data to predict potential health risks during pregnancy, labor, and the postpartum period. The dataset for this task includes critical maternal health parameters such as the patient's age, blood sugar levels, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and other relevant clinical metrics. These features are used to assess the risk of perinatal complications like gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and other conditions that could affect maternal and fetal outcomes. By applying machine learning models to this data, healthcare providers can make proactive decisions to mitigate risks and improve health outcomes for both mother and baby.

Perinatal health risk prediction has several important real-world use cases, particularly in maternal and fetal healthcare. Below are some of the key applications and how they can be implemented in real-world settings:
1. Early Detection of High-Risk Pregnancies
Use Case: The model can predict high-risk pregnancies by analyzing factors like age, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels, allowing healthcare providers to identify women at risk for complications such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, or preterm labor.
Real-World Impact: Early interventions can be taken to provide specialized care, such as additional monitoring, medication adjustments, or early delivery planning, reducing adverse outcomes for mother and baby.
2. Personalized Prenatal Care Plans
Use Case: Based on the risk predictions, healthcare professionals can create personalized care plans, including the frequency of prenatal visits, dietary recommendations, and exercise routines tailored to the individual's risk profile.
Real-World Impact: Personalized care plans can improve maternal health, reduce stress, and optimize the allocation of healthcare resources, ensuring that at-risk patients receive the necessary attention and interventions.
3. Gestational Diabetes Prediction
Use Case: By analyzing blood sugar levels and other relevant factors, the model can predict the likelihood of a pregnant woman developing gestational diabetes, which is crucial for timely diagnosis and management.
Real-World Impact: Early prediction allows for dietary and lifestyle changes, glucose monitoring, and medication interventions, helping prevent complications like high birth weight or the need for cesarean delivery.
4. Predicting Preeclampsia
Use Case: Using features like systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the model can predict the risk of preeclampsia, a dangerous condition characterized by high blood pressure that can lead to serious complications for both mother and baby.
Real-World Impact: Early detection allows healthcare providers to closely monitor blood pressure, prescribe antihypertensive medications, and plan for early delivery if necessary, thereby reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity.
